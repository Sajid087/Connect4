Connect Four is a classic two-player board game in which the objective is to be the first to form a line of four of your own colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal on a grid. Each player takes turns dropping their colored discs (usually red and yellow) into the columns of a vertical grid. The discs fall to the lowest available position within the chosen column.

Here's a basic description of how to implement a simple Connect Four game in Python:

Setting Up the Game Board:

Create a grid (usually 6x7) to represent the game board.
You can use a list of lists or a NumPy array to represent the grid.
Initialize the grid with empty slots (e.g., 0 for empty, 1 for player 1, and 2 for player 2).
Displaying the Game Board:

Create a function to display the current state of the game board.
You can use ASCII characters or graphical elements to represent the discs on the grid.
Update the display after each move.
Player Input:

Implement a mechanism for players to input their moves (usually column number).
Validate the input to ensure it's a valid column and there's room for the disc.
Game Logic:

Check for a win condition after each move by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals for four consecutive discs of the same color.
Implement a function to check for a draw (a full board with no winner).
Turn-Based Play:

Alternate turns between the two players until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
Winning Announcement:

When a player wins, display a message announcing the winner.
Allow players to start a new game if they want.
